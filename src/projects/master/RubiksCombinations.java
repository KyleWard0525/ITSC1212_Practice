/**
 * Welcome to the Thunderdome that is the Master level! 
 * The level of Master is not just a name. These problems
 * are designed to not only be extremely challenging but 
 * may also incorporate advanced concepts and techniques.
 * That being said,
 * 
 * In this problem you are tasked with computing the number of 
 * all possible patterns/combinations that can be made by an 
 * n-by-n Rubik's cube. 
 * 
 * There are a few general rules that hold for all size cubes:
 * 
 * 1) Every cube will have 8 corner pieces, each of which has 8 possible permutations
 * 2) The corner pieces can be oriented in 3 different ways 
 * 3) 3x3 has 12, 4x4 has 24, 5x5 has 36, and so on..
